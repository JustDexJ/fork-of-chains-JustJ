<p>

Living in the western forest, Wood Mousekin used to be hunted for sport by the
<<rep setup.trait.race_neko>>. It's uncertain from which race and place they have
evolved from, many people believe that they are a result of <<rep setup.trait.subrace_demon>> testing experimental
potions and retrials on ordinary Wood Mice. After it was shown that they are hear to stay and
can breed at an accelerated rate. It was proven that they made good cheap labour.
</p>
<p>
<<rep setup.trait.skill_nimble>> and <<rep setup.trait.skill_fast>> the
cheap labour they are most suited for is a computer. They can perform mathematical
calculations using simple pen and paper arithmetic far faster than most other species.
Their biggest contractors for them are the tiger bank and working out supplies and market
transactions for the neko and elves.
</p>
<p>
Weak and not overly wise, they are easily lured into a trap or contract
that basically enslaves them to the job. Paid in apples and promised better windows
if they behave. They work in the backrooms of shops and basements of houses spread
throughout <<lore region_forest>>.
