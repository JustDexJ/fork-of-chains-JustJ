<p>
It is believed that Tigerkin are a different branch evolutionary speaking to <<rep setup.trait.subrace_neko>>.  Both originate from the ancient race of <<rep setup.trait.race_catkin>>.
Unlike their modern counterpart, tigerkin possesses fully furry bodies.
In times past, these anthropomorphic tigers
inhabited the <<lore region_forest>> alongside their enemies, the ancient elves.
Books tell of many dual-wielding <<rep setup.trait.skill_ambidextrous>>,
and their great mastery over <<lore magic_earth>>.

The ones that are left are hard working, proud species who in modern times are in control of the Tiger Bank. The largest banking institution that on the surface looks to be run by Neko,
located in their city after all. This means Tigerkin don't get their paws dirty often, preferring to use their influence with the bank or on slaving companies to enforce their dominance.
Sometimes, slave companies will get the location of a delinquent from the Tiger Bank and will enslave them. Tigerkin don't have a lot of uses for slaves, as they prefer to do actions themselves.
Therefore the slaving company gets to keep the new slave to do as they wish, serving as a warning to everyone who doesn't pay the Tigerkin enough respect. The slaves they do collect themselves are normally given
to a slaving company for ‘intensive training’. Normally to test the slaving company loyalty and quality they can produce.

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright <br/>
In the forests of the night, <br/>
What immortal hand or eye <br/>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? <br/>
