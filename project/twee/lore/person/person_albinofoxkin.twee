Ivory the albino foxkin started his life like many of his brothers inside a kennel,
mother giving birth under the full moon. Treated little more than animals a werewolf was present at his birth,
someone he would later only know as ‘The Veterinarian’. His arrival caused a lot of excitement in the colony of werewolves.
His skin pure white, eyes a loving pink. Many came and went just to get a look at the most valuable thing in camp.

<p>
Removed from his mother as soon as he could eat solid food, he felt more like a carnival attraction than a person. As a young adult the
training was worse, stretching his hole, staying erect for hours, standing still holding a coat like a piece of furniture. The werewolves seemed
to pay a lot of attention to him and became cruel at any mistake he made.

<p>
His savior came in a lizardkin king, apparently a ruler of a far flung land paid a sack of gold for him. Kind, sweet, the king seemed to enjoy spending
every second of his spare time stroking, brushing, and masterbating the albino fox. Enjoying the little soft mones, the cute eyes and soft pure white skin.
He was named Ivory, after the bone statues that the king processed.

<p>
At balls, parties, cort meetings Ivory was always close by, standing like a statue, holding a candle, otherwise under the table,
relieving the guests who traveled a long way to meet the king or him. Eventually the king fell in love with Ivory, now it's rumored he shares
the throne on the king's lap every day, going out with the king everywhere he goes. Deeply happily in love. The dragonkin king and his loving naked
albino foxkin. Ivory had found a true owner, he wanted to spend the rest of his days in his arms.
